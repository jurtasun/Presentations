Resolving nanometric scales: From genomic sequencing to SR imaging of chromatin

The field of genomics ranges from...
thourout the years diffraction has been found to be a limit on the way small scales can be accesded by classic microscopy.
Nevertheless, modert techniques such as SR imagin techniques allow for ... chromatin accesibility.
We present here a quick overview of how Computational ap;roaches, from deep learning to Monte Carlo algorithms can be applied to analyting SR data.
